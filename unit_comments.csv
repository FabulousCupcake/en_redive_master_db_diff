1003009,100331,1,4,1,0.0,1,"(Such an odd feeling... It's like I want to keep doing this forever. But that's not realistic, of course.)"
1003010,100331,1,5,1,0.0,1,"I know I said I would do anything you asked... But nothing indecent, all right?"
1003011,100301,2,6,2,2.6,5,"Happy birthday. I'm afraid I wasn't sure what to get you for a present... How about we go out somewhere instead?"
1003012,100331,2,6,1,0.0,1,"I hear it's your birthday, so let's take a break from training today. ...Hmm? Does that not make you happy?"
