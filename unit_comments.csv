1001003,100101,1,3,1,7.5,2,"Gotta stay full of energy! But when you're tired, it's best to get some rest. Me? I'm not sleepy yet!"
1001004,100101,1,4,5,6.0,2,"Hey, wanna hear a secret? When I'm with you, life seems twice as fun! Eheheh... Thanks a bunch!"
1001005,100101,1,5,4,6.0,6,"It's weird... Sometimes I get this fuzzy feeling in my chest. I haven't caught a cold or something, have I?!"

1001007,100131,1,2,1,0.0,1,"I don't mind getting a little beaten up! As long as I know you've got my back, I can always keep fighting!"

1002009,100231,1,4,1,0.0,1,"Hmm, what kind of magic should I study next? L-love magic, maybe? N-no, I'm sure there's no such thing!"
1002010,100231,1,5,1,0.0,1,"I've been learning protective magic! Spells to protect from fire, cold, heat... And, um, fish bones. They can really hurt your throat..."
1003001,100301,1,1,1,4.0,2,"I'll put in as much effort as it takes to achieve my goals. I think that's a good attitude to have—you should try it too."
1003002,100301,1,2,2,4.5,6,"Could you help me come up with a new training plan? I'm trying to find a good location..."
1003003,100301,1,3,1,4.5,2,"The desire to become stronger is what matters. As long as you don't lose sight of it, you'll become stronger too."
1003004,100301,1,4,6,2.0,2,"I'm not sure why, but when I cross swords with you, it feels almost like dancing."
1003005,100301,1,5,1,4.5,2,"Do you want to go fishing with me? I enjoy fishing alone as well, but I'd like to share it with you..."
1003006,100331,1,1,1,0.0,1,"Ready your weapon! If you ever plan to land a clean blow on me, there's no time to waste!"
1003007,100331,1,2,1,0.0,1,"That unrelenting look in your eyes... You really are quite something. I knew I was right about you."
1003008,100331,1,3,1,0.0,1,"You can become so much stronger—I know you haven't reached your limit yet. So go ahead and prove it to me."
1003009,100331,1,4,1,0.0,1,"(Such an odd feeling... It's like I want to keep doing this forever. But that's not realistic, of course.)"
1003010,100331,1,5,1,0.0,1,"I know I said I would do anything you asked... But nothing indecent, all right?"
1004001,100401,1,1,1,2.5,2,"Oh, hey there, mister! What d'you wanna play today?"
1004002,100401,1,2,4,4.0,4,"Urghhhh... I accidentally ate my own super-spicy prank candy..."

1004006,100431,1,1,1,0.0,1,"Misogi Explorers, assemble! ...Pretty easy to assemble when it's just the two of us, huh?"
1004007,100431,1,2,1,0.0,1,"I'm looking forward to toying with you lots and lots more! Ah, sorry, I meant ""playing with."" Honest!"
1004008,100431,1,3,1,0.0,1,"C'mon, mister! Hurry up! Let's go exploring! I've been waiting for you!"
1004009,100431,1,4,1,0.0,1,"Since I like you so much, I'm gonna come up with lots more pranks just for you!"

1005003,100501,1,3,1,8.8,4,"My mom and dad always want me to wear cute outfits. All covered in ribbons and lace... Simple and practical is more my style!"
1005004,100501,1,4,1,4.6,5,"We should go somewhere quiet together once in a while. Even heroes need to rest sometimes!"
1005005,100501,1,5,4,9.8,5,"I really wanna play with you\nall day long! But if we get any closer, you'll find out my...\nN-no! I didn't say anything!"
1005006,100531,1,1,1,0.0,1,"Haaahhhh!\nAs long as we have the\ncourage to stand up to evil,\njustice will always prevail!"

1006001,100601,1,1,5,3.5,2,"Say, would you come help me with my saxophone practice later?"
1006002,100601,1,2,4,5.0,5,"*pant... pant...* That's enough sax for now... You really know how to wear a girl out..."
1006003,100601,1,3,6,3.0,4,"What? You want to keep going? But I'm so worn out... I don't have much more in me..."
1006004,100601,1,4,5,5.5,2,"You always push me so hard, it makes me all sweaty... My heart's pounding like crazy..."
1006005,100601,1,5,3,4.5,4,"Say, if you had to choose between me and my sister, which would you... Ah, no, it's nothing."

1008008,100831,1,3,1,0.0,1,"Don't be embarrassed that you're not as beautiful as me. That's just as natural as the sky being blue."
1008009,100831,1,4,1,0.0,1,"Perhaps someday I'll give you a present more precious than any jewel. I mean myself, of course. Would that make you happy?"
1008010,100831,1,5,1,0.0,1,"The precious joy of having me by your side... The gleaming world we'll create together... Truly, the world is brimming with hope."

1032003,103201,1,3,4,6.5,5,"I have a poor sense of direction, but it's not that bad. Which way is my house, again?"
1032004,103201,1,4,1,6.0,2,"I'll wait as long as it takes for you to become my knight. Then we'll travel the world!"
1032005,103201,1,5,1,3.5,2,"There are some things money can't buy. Like your heart, for example!"
1032006,103231,1,1,1,0.0,1,"I live by the teachings of House Wisteria! A true merchant is also a full-fledged fighter!"

1034002,103401,1,2,1,6.5,2,"Hey, are you busy? Wanna go grab a drink with me? Soft drinks for you, of course."
1034003,103401,1,3,6,5.0,5,"I brought my work home, but there's just no end in sight! *groan* Can you help me?"
1034004,103401,1,4,2,7.5,2,"Hic! You're real warm, y'know that? I drank a bit too much, so c'mere and warm me up."
1034005,103401,1,5,1,4.0,2,"Are you eating right? I'd be happy to cook for you if you want."
1034006,103431,1,1,1,0.0,1,"Mmm, these berries smell awesome! They'd go great in a mixer. No! I'm at work!"

1034008,103431,1,3,1,0.0,1,"I feel all warm and fuzzy... Maybe it's just because of you?"
1034009,103431,1,4,1,0.0,1,"When you're old enough to drink, we should go out and celebrate with a few cold ones!"
1034010,103431,1,5,1,0.0,1,"What'cha say we go out on a date? Or would you rather not be seen with me?"
1036001,103601,1,1,1,5.9,5,"It's study time right now, so please don't talk to m—\n...Oh, don't look so crestfallen!\nFine, I'll play with you!"
