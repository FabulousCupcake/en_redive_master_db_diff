1001002001,10010,2,"This temple exists to offer up and purify the wishes of those who\nvisit. But some wishes can't be fulfilled, causing them to become\ncorporeal and attack its visitors. Yui and co., requested to act as\nsecurity on the premises, to which they accept."
1001002002,10010,2,"Though the crew find themselves incredibly busy due to all the\nvisitors, they get by with the help of those around then. A\ncorporeal wish in search of its parents appears, but is\nsuccessfully purified when Hiyori acts as a surrogate mother for it."
1001002003,10010,2,"Just as the crew find themselves getting used to their work, a\ncorporeal wish that wants to know how to kiss someone\nappears. The shock causes Yui to collapse, leading Mr. Knight to\ncatch and almost kiss her, successfully purifying the wish."
1001002004,10010,2,"Visitors increase as night falls, leaving the crew even busier than\nusual. Another corporeal wish appears, this time in search of\nsomeone who can cheer it up. Rei steps up to the challenge,\nsuccessfully purifying it through her sheer desperation."
1001002005,10010,2,"Having purified a number of wishes at this point, the crew decide\nto take a break. The last few hours of the year contain the highest\ndensity of wishes, however, causing a swarm of them to\nmaterialize and morph into a black mist that envelops the temple."
